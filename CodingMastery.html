                      <p class="card-text"><span class="input-holder name"></span> had always been <span class="input-holder" id="adjective-one"></span> by technology and had dreamed of becoming a <span class="input-holder noun-one"></span> She had taken a few online courses in programming before, but had always given up halfway through, feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the subject matter. However, she was determined to succeed and refused to let her past failures hold her back.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"><span class="input-holder name"></span> knew that learning to code would require a lot of effort and dedication, so she decided to start small and <span class="input-holder" id="verb-two"></span> her way up gradually. She began by reading online tutorials and watching video lectures, taking notes along the way to help her retain the information. She also practiced <span class="input-holder noun-three"></span> exercises regularly, using various online resources to challenge herself and build her skills.</p>
                        
                      <p class="card-text">Despite her best efforts, <span class="input-holder name"></span> found that she was still struggling to grasp some of the more <span class="input-holder" id="adjective-two"></span> concepts. She began to doubt her ability to succeed and wondered if she was cut out for a career in programming. But instead of giving up, she sought out help from other <span class="input-holder noun-one"></span>s and joined online communities where she could ask questions and receive feedback on her code.</p>
                        
                      <p class="card-text">With the help of her peers and mentors, <span class="input-holder name"></span> gradually overcame her obstacles and began to make progress in her <span class="input-holder noun-three"></span> skills. She started building her own projects and experimenting with new programming languages, putting into practice what she had learned from her studies.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">As time went on, <span class="input-holder name"></span>'s hard work and determination paid off. She landed a job as a junior developer at a <span class="input-holder noun-two"></span> startup, and over the years she worked her way up to a senior position. Today, she is a successful software engineer who has built many innovative products and contributed to the <span class="input-holder noun-two"></span> industry in a meaningful way.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"><span class="input-holder name"></span>'s success story shows that even when faced with obstacles, with the right mindset and approach, it is possible to overcome them and achieve your goals. By starting small, seeking out help when needed, and <span class="input-holder" id="verb-one"></span> through the difficult moments, anyone can learn to code and build a career in <span class="input-holder noun-two"></span>.</p>
